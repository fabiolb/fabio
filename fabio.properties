# proxy.addr configures the HTTP and HTTPS listeners as a comma separated list.
#
# To configure an HTTP listener provide [host]:port.
# To configure an HTTPS listener provide [host]:port;certFile;keyFile;clientAuthFile.
# certFile and keyFile contain the public/private key pair for that listener
# in PEM format. If certFile contains both the public and private key then
# keyFile can be omittted.
# clientAuthFile contains the root CAs for client certificate validation.
# When clientAuthFile is provided the TLS configuration is set to
# RequireAndVerifyClientCert.
#

#
# This configures the DialTimeout of the network dialer.
#
# The default is

# registry.consul.token configures the acl token for consul.
#
# The default is
#
# registry.consul.token =


# registry.consul.kvpath configures the KV path for manual routes.
#

# the routing table. This allows for manual overrides and weighted
# round-robin routes.
#
# The default is
#
# registry.consul.kvpath = /fabio/config


# registry.consul.tagprefix configures the prefix for tags which define routes.
#
# Services which define routes publish one or more tags with host/path

# recognized as routes.
#
# The default is
#
# registry.consul.tagprefix = urlprefix-


# registry.consul.register.addr configures the address for the service registration.
#
# Fabio registers itself in consul with this host:port address.

#
# Fabio registers an http health check on http://${ui.addr}/health
# and this value tells consul how long to wait for a response.
#
# The default is
#
# registry.consul.register.checkTimeout = 3s


# metrics.target configures the backend the metrics values are
# sent to.
#
# Possible values are:
#  <empty>:  do not report metrics
#  stdout:   report metrics to stdout
#  graphite: report metrics to Graphite on ${metrics.graphite.addr}
#
# The default is
#
# metrics.target =


# metrics.prefix configures the prefix of all reported metrics.

# runtime.gogc configures GOGC (the GC target percentage).
#
# Setting runtime.gogc is equivalent to setting the GOGC
# environment variable which also takes precendence over
# the value from the config file.
#
# Increasing this value means fewer but longer GC cycles
# since there is more garbage to collect.
#
# The default of GOGC=100 works for Go 1.4 but shows
# a significant performance drop for Go 1.5 since the
# concurrent GC kicks in more often.
#
# During benchmarking I have found the following values
# to work for my setup and for now I consider them sane
# defaults for both Go 1.4 and Go 1.5.
#
# GOGC=100: Go 1.5 40% slower than Go 1.4
# GOGC=200: Go 1.5 == Go 1.4 with GOGC=100 (default)
# GOGC=800: both Go 1.4 and 1.5 significanlty faster (40%/go1.4, 100%/go1.5)
#
# The default is
#
# runtime.gogc = 800


# runtime.gomaxprocs configures GOMAXPROCS.
#
# Setting runtime.gomaxprocs is equivalent to setting the GOMAXPROCS
# environment variable which also takes precendence over
# the value from the config file.
#
# If runtime.gomaxprocs < 0 then all CPU cores are used.
#
# The default is
#
# runtime.gomaxprocs = -1


# ui.addr configures the address the UI is listening on
#
# The default is
#
# ui.addr = :9998
