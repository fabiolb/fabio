# proxy.cs configures one or more certificate sources.
#
# Each certificate source is configured with a list of
# key/value options. Each source must have a unique
# name which can then be referred to in a listener
# configuration.
#
#   cs=<name>;type=<type>;opt=arg;opt[=arg];...
#
# All certificates need to be provided in PEM format.
#
# The following types of certificate sources are available:
#
# File
#
# The file certificate source supports one certificate which is loaded at
# startup and is cached until the service exits.
#
# The 'cert' option contains the path to the certificate file. The 'key'
# option contains the path to the private key file. If the certificate file
# contains both the certificate and the private key the 'key' option can be
# omitted. The 'clientca' option contains the path to one or more client
# authentication certificates.
#
#   cs=<name>;type=file;cert=p/a-cert.pem;key=p/a-key.pem;clientca=p/clientAuth.pem
#
# Path
#
# The path certificate source loads certificates from a directory in
# alphabetical order and refreshes them periodically.
#
# The 'cert' option provides the path to the TLS certificates and the
# 'clientca' option provides the path to the certificates for client
# authentication.
#
# TLS certificates are stored either in one or two files:
#
#   www.example.com.pem or www.example.com-{cert,key}.pem
#
# TLS certificates are loaded in alphabetical order and the first certificate
# is the default for clients which do not support SNI.
#
# The 'refresh' option can be set to specify the refresh interval for the TLS
# certificates. Client authentication certificates cannot be refreshed since
# Go does not provide a mechanism for that yet.
#
# The default refresh interval is 3 seconds and cannot be lower than 1 second
# to prevent busy loops. To load the certificates only once and disable
# automatic refreshing set 'refresh' to zero.
#
#   cs=<name>;type=path;cert=path/to/certs;clientca=path/to/clientcas;refresh=3s
#
# HTTP
#
# The http certificate source loads certificates from an HTTP/HTTPS server.
#
# The 'cert' option provides a URL to a text file which contains all files
# that should be loaded from this directory. The filenames follow the same
# rules as for the path source. The text file can be generated with:
#
#   ls -1 *.pem > list
#
# The 'clientca' option provides a URL for the client authentication
# certificates analogous to the 'cert' option.
#
# Authentication credentials can be provided in the URL as request parameter,
# as basic authentication parameters or through a header.
#
# The 'refresh' option can be set to specify the refresh interval for the TLS
# certificates. Client authentication certificates cannot be refreshed since
# Go does not provide a mechanism for that yet.
#
# The default refresh interval is 3 seconds and cannot be lower than 1 second
# to prevent busy loops. To load the certificates only once and disable
# automatic refreshing set 'refresh' to zero.
#
#   cs=<name>;type=http;cert=https://host.com/path/to/cert/list&token=123
#   cs=<name>;type=http;cert=https://user:pass@host.com/path/to/cert/list
#   cs=<name>;type=http;cert=https://host.com/path/to/cert/list;hdr=Authorization: Bearer 1234
#
# Consul
#
# The consul certificate source loads certificates from consul.
#
# The 'cert' option provides a KV store URL where the the TLS certificates are
# stored.
#
# The 'clientca' option provides a URL to a path in the KV store where the the
# client authentication certificates are stored.
#
# The filenames follow the same rules as for the path source.
#
# The TLS certificates are updated automatically whenever the KV store
# changes. The client authentication certificates cannot be updated
# automatically since Go does not provide a mechanism for that yet.
#
#   cs=<name>;type=consul;cert=http://localhost:8500/v1/kv/path/to/cert&token=123
#
# Vault
#
# The Vault certificate store uses HashiCorp Vault as the certificate
# store.
#
# The 'cert' option provides the path to the TLS certificates and the
# 'clientca' option provides the path to the certificates for client
# authentication.
#
# The 'refresh' option can be set to specify the refresh interval for the TLS
# certificates. Client authentication certificates cannot be refreshed since
# Go does not provide a mechanism for that yet.
#
# The default refresh interval is 3 seconds and cannot be lower than 1 second
# to prevent busy loops. To load the certificates only once and disable
# automatic refreshing set 'refresh' to zero.
#
# The path to vault must be provided in the VAULT_ADDR environment
# variable. The token must be provided in the VAULT_TOKEN environment
# variable.
#
#   cs=<name>;type=vault;cert=secret/fabio/certs
#
# Vault PKI
#
# The Vault PKI certificate store uses HashiCorp Vault's PKI backend to issue
# certificates on-demand.
#
# The 'cert' option provides a PKI backend path for issuing certificates. The
# 'clientca' option works in the same way as for the generic Vault source.
#
# The 'refresh' option determines how long before the expiration date
# certificates are re-issued. Values smaller than one hour are silently changed
# to one hour, which is also the default.
#
#   cs=<name>;type=vault-pki;cert=pki/issue/example-dot-com;refresh=24h;clientca=secret/fabio/client-certs
#
# This source will issue server certificates on-demand using the PKI backend
# and re-issue them 24 hours before they expire. The CA for client
# authentication is expected to be stored at secret/fabio/client-certs.
#
# Common options
#
# All certificate stores support the following options:
#
#   caupgcn: Upgrade a self-signed client auth certificate with this common-name
#            to a CA certificate. Typically used for self-singed certificates
#            for the Amazon AWS Api Gateway certificates which do not have the
#            CA flag set which makes them unsuitable for client certificate
#            authentication in Go. For the AWS Api Gateway set this value
#            to 'ApiGateway' to allow client certificate authentication.
#            This replaces the deprecated parameter 'aws.apigw.cert.cn'
#            which was introduced in version 1.1.5.
#
# Examples:
#
#     # file based certificate source
#     proxy.cs = cs=some-name;type=file;cert=p/a-cert.pem;key=p/a-key.pem
#
#     # path based certificate source
#     proxy.cs = cs=some-name;type=path;path=path/to/certs
#
#     # HTTP certificate source
#     proxy.cs = cs=some-name;type=http;cert=https://user:pass@host:port/path/to/certs
#
#     # Consul certificate source
#     proxy.cs = cs=some-name;type=consul;cert=https://host:port/v1/kv/path/to/certs?token=abc123
#
#     # Vault certificate source
#     proxy.cs = cs=some-name;type=vault;cert=secret/fabio/certs
#
#     # Vault PKI certificate source
#     proxy.cs = cs=some-name;type=vault-pki;cert=pki/issue/example-dot-com
#
#     # Multiple certificate sources
#     proxy.cs = cs=srcA;type=path;path=path/to/certs,\
#                cs=srcB;type=http;cert=https://user:pass@host:port/path/to/certs
#
#     # path based certificate source for AWS Api Gateway
#     proxy.cs = cs=some-name;type=path;path=path/to/certs;clientca=path/to/clientcas;caupgcn=ApiGateway
#
# The default is

# proxy.cs =


# proxy.addr configures listeners.
#
# Each listener is configured with and address and a
# list of optional arguments in the form of
#
#   [host]:port;opt=arg;opt[=arg];...
#
# Each listener has a protocol which is configured
# with the 'proto' option for which it routes and
# forwards traffic.
#
# The supported protocols are:
#
#   * http for HTTP based protocols
#   * https for HTTPS based protocols
#   * tcp for a raw TCP proxy with or witout TLS support
#   * tcp+sni for an SNI aware TCP proxy
#
# If no 'proto' option is specified then the protocol
# is either 'http' or 'https' depending on whether a
# certificate source is configured via the 'cs' option
# which contains the name of the certificate source.
#
# The TCP+SNI proxy analyzes the ClientHello message
# of TLS connections to extract the server name
# extension and then forwards the encrypted traffic
# to the destination without decrypting the traffic.
#
# General options:
#
#   rt:          Sets the read timeout as a duration value (e.g. '3s')
#
#   wt:          Sets the write timeout as a duration value (e.g. '3s')
#
#   strictmatch: When set to 'true' the certificate source must provide
#                a certificate that matches the hostname for the connection
#                to be established. Otherwise, the first certificate is used
#                if no matching certificate was found. This matches the default
#                behavior of the Go TLS server implementation.
#
#   pxyproto:    When set to 'true' the listener will respect upstream v1
#                PROXY protocol headers.
#                NOTE: PROXY protocol was on by default from 1.1.3 to 1.5.10.
#                This changed to off when this option was introduced with
#                the 1.5.11 release.
#                For more information about the PROXY protocol, please see:
#                http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt
#
#   pxytimeout:  Sets PROXY protocol header read timeout as a duration (e.g. '250ms').
#                This defaults to 250ms if not set when 'pxyproto' is enabled.
#
# TLS options:
#
#   tlsmin:      Sets the minimum TLS version for the handshake. This value
#                is one of [ssl30, tls10, tls11, tls12] or the corresponding
#                version number from https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#pkg-constants
#
#   tlsmax:      Sets the maximum TLS version for the handshake. See 'tlsmin'
#                for the format.
#
#   tlsciphers:  Sets the list of allowed ciphers for the handshake. The value
#                is a quoted comma-separated list of the hex cipher values or
#                the constant names from https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#pkg-constants,
#                e.g. "0xc00a,0xc02b" or "TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA"
#
# Examples:

# runtime.gogc configures GOGC (the GC target percentage).
#
# Setting runtime.gogc is equivalent to setting the GOGC
# environment variable which also takes precedence over
# the value from the config file.
#
# Increasing this value means fewer but longer GC cycles
# since there is more garbage to collect.
#
# The default of GOGC=100 works for Go 1.4 but shows
# a significant performance drop for Go 1.5 since the
# concurrent GC kicks in more often.
#
# During benchmarking I have found the following values
# to work for my setup and for now I consider them sane
# defaults for both Go 1.4 and Go 1.5.
#
# GOGC=100: Go 1.5 40% slower than Go 1.4
# GOGC=200: Go 1.5 == Go 1.4 with GOGC=100 (default)
# GOGC=800: both Go 1.4 and 1.5 significantly faster (40%/go1.4, 100%/go1.5)

#
# The default is
#
# runtime.gomaxprocs = -1

# The listener uses the same syntax as proxy.addr but
# supports only a single listener. To enable HTTPS
# configure a certificate source. You should use
# a different certificate source than the one you
# use for the external connections, e.g. 'cs=ui'.
#

# tracing.Topic sets the Topic String used if tracing.CollectorType is kafka and
# tracing.ConnectSting is set to a kafka broker
#
# The default is
#
# tracing.Topic = Fabiolb-Kafka-Topic


# tracing.SamplerRate is the rate at which opentrace span data will be collected and sent
# If SamplerRate is <= 0 Never sample
# If SamplerRate is >= 1.0 always sample
# Values between 0 and 1 will be the percentage in decimal form
